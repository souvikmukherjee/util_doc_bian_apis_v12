**Limitations**

PUT: Based on REST best practices\, the name of the path should focus on resources rather than actions or operations\. Given the path '/eTradingWorkbench/\{etradingworkbenchid\}/InvestmentPortfolioValuation/\{investmentportfoliovaluationid\}/Update'\, we can simplify it to '/eTradingWorkbench/\{etradingworkbenchid\}/InvestmentPortfolioValuation/\{investmentportfoliovaluationid\}' as the resource identifier\. The update operation can be represented by using appropriate HTTP methods such as PUT or PATCH on this
