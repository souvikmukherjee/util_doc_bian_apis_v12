# ProductionRelease

**BIAN Documentation:** [ProductionRelease v12](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/BIAN-3/ProductionRelease/12.0.0)

## POST: /ProductionRelease/Evaluate

:::info Path
POST: /ProductionRelease/Evaluate
:::

### Description

Maintain and apply production release tests for new and updated systems EvCR Evaluate various risk exposures for a production release

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows you to create and apply production release tests for new and updated systems\. It helps evaluate the various risks associated with a production release\. By using this API\, you can maintain and assess the potential risks involved in deploying new or updated systems into a production environment\.

**Limitations**

POST: In RESTful design\, the path '/ProductionRelease/Evaluate' should be named in a resource\-oriented manner\. A common convention is to use plural nouns to represent resources\. So\, a possible more RESTful name for this path could be '/production\-releases/evaluations'\. This naming convention helps make the API more intuitive and easier to understand for developers\.

## PUT: /ProductionRelease/\{productionreleaseid\}/Update

:::info Path
PUT: /ProductionRelease/\{productionreleaseid\}/Update
:::

### Description

Maintain and apply production release tests for new and updated systems UpCR Update aspects of an active production release evaluation

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows you to update aspects of an active production release evaluation for new or updated systems\. It involves maintaining and applying production release tests to ensure that the systems are functioning properly\, and making necessary updates as required during the production release process\.

**Limitations**

PUT: The name of the RESTful path should be:

\`\`\`text
PUT /production\-releases/\{productionreleaseid\}
\`\`\` 

This path follows REST best practices by using lowercase letters\, using hyphens to separate words\, and includes the action in the HTTP method \(PUT\) rather than the path itself\.

## PUT: /ProductionRelease/\{productionreleaseid\}/Request

:::info Path
PUT: /ProductionRelease/\{productionreleaseid\}/Request
:::

### Description

Maintain and apply production release tests for new and updated systems RqCR Request manual intervention in an evaluation

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows users to update an existing resource related to maintaining and applying production release tests for new and updated systems\. Specifically\, it enables users to request manual intervention in an evaluation process for a production release identified by the \{productionreleaseid\}\. The purpose is to allow for human intervention or review in the evaluation process of the production release\.

**Limitations**

PUT: Following REST best practices\, the name of the path should be:

/production\-releases/\{productionreleaseid\}/requests

In this format:
\- Use lowercase letters for consistency
\- Use plural nouns for collections\, such as 'production\-releases' and 'requests'
\- Use hyphens to separate words in a path rather than underscores to improve readability

## GET: /ProductionRelease/\{productionreleaseid\}/Retrieve

:::info Path
GET: /ProductionRelease/\{productionreleaseid\}/Retrieve
:::

### Description

Maintain and apply production release tests for new and updated systems ReCR Retrieve details about a production release evaluation

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows you to retrieve details about a production release evaluation\. It is used to access information related to maintaining and applying production release tests for new and updated systems\. By making a GET request to this endpoint with the specified production release ID\, you can retrieve data and details about a specific production release evaluation\.

**Limitations**

GET: The name of the path should be: 

GET /production\-releases/\{productionReleaseId\} 

This naming convention follows REST best practices by using lowercase letters\, hyphens to separate words\, and using singular nouns for resources\.

## GET: /ProductionRelease/\{productionreleaseid\}/FunctionalRisk/\{functionalriskid\}/Retrieve

:::info Path
GET: /ProductionRelease/\{productionreleaseid\}/FunctionalRisk/\{functionalriskid\}/Retrieve
:::

### Description

Maintain and apply production release tests for new and updated systems ReBQ Retrieve details about a functional risk assessment

**Documentation**

This API path is used to retrieve details about a functional risk assessment within the context of maintaining and applying production release tests for new and updated systems\. By specifying the production release ID and functional risk ID in the path\, the API allows users to retrieve specific information related to a particular functional risk assessment\. This information can be useful for assessing and managing risks associated with production releases of systems\, helping organizations ensure the quality and stability of their systems during deployments\.

**Limitations**

GET: A suggested RESTful name for this path would be: 

GET '/production\-releases/\{productionreleaseid\}/functional\-risks/\{functionalriskid\}'

## GET: /ProductionRelease/\{productionreleaseid\}/ProductionRisk/\{productionriskid\}/Retrieve

:::info Path
GET: /ProductionRelease/\{productionreleaseid\}/ProductionRisk/\{productionriskid\}/Retrieve
:::

### Description

Maintain and apply production release tests for new and updated systems ReBQ Retrieve details about a production risk assessment

**Documentation**

This API path allows you to retrieve details about a production risk assessment for a specific production release\. By providing the production release ID and production risk ID in the path\, you can access information related to the risk assessment associated with that particular production release\. This functionality helps in maintaining and applying production release tests for new and updated systems by giving insights into potential risks related to the release\.

**Limitations**

GET: A good naming convention for this path following REST best practices would be:

GET '/production\-releases/\{productionreleaseid\}/production\-risks/\{productionriskid\}'

## GET: /ProductionRelease/\{productionreleaseid\}/BusinessRisk/\{businessriskid\}/Retrieve

:::info Path
GET: /ProductionRelease/\{productionreleaseid\}/BusinessRisk/\{businessriskid\}/Retrieve
:::

### Description

Maintain and apply production release tests for new and updated systems ReBQ Retrieve details about a business risk assessment

**Documentation**

This API path allows users to retrieve details about a business risk assessment associated with a specific production release\. By providing the production release ID and business risk ID as parameters in the request\, users can access information related to the risk assessment as it pertains to the production release process\. This can help in monitoring and managing potential risks associated with new or updated systems being released into production\.

**Limitations**

GET: The name of the path following REST best practices could be something like:

GET '/production\-releases/\{productionreleaseId\}/business\-risks/\{businessRiskId\}'

## GET: /ProductionRelease/\{productionreleaseid\}/OperationalRisk/\{operationalriskid\}/Retrieve

:::info Path
GET: /ProductionRelease/\{productionreleaseid\}/OperationalRisk/\{operationalriskid\}/Retrieve
:::

### Description

Maintain and apply production release tests for new and updated systems ReBQ Retrieve details about a operational risk assessment

**Documentation**

This API path allows you to retrieve details about an operational risk assessment that is associated with a specific production release\. You can access information about the operational risk by providing the production release ID and the operational risk ID as parameters in the API call\. This can help in maintaining and applying production release tests for new and updated systems by understanding the potential operational risks involved\.

**Limitations**

GET: Based on REST best practices\, the name of the path should be:

/production\-releases/\{productionreleaseid\}/operational\-risks/\{operationalriskid\}
