### POST: /FraudResolution/Initiate

**Description**

This service domain sets up and processes a fraud case resulting from fraud behavior that has been detected during production processing InCR Initiate a fraud case

**Documentation**

This API path "/FraudResolution/Initiate" is used to create a new fraud case in the fraud resolution system\. When fraud behavior is detected during production processing\, this API allows users to initiate a fraud case by providing the necessary details and information related to the detected fraud activity\. The system then processes this information to investigate and resolve the fraud case\.

**Limitations**

POST: If the path '/FraudResolution/Initiate' followed REST best practices\, it should be named as '/fraud\-resolutions' using plural form for collections\. So the updated path would be '/fraud\-resolutions'\.

### PUT: /FraudResolution/\{fraudresolutionid\}/Update

**Description**

This service domain sets up and processes a fraud case resulting from fraud behavior that has been detected during production processing UpCR Update details of an active fraud case

**Documentation**

This API path allows you to update the details of an active fraud case identified by a specific fraud resolution ID\. By using the PUT method\, you can make changes to the information related to the fraud case\, such as updating case details or adding new information\.

**Limitations**

PUT: The appropriate name for the path '/FraudResolution/\{fraudresolutionid\}/Update' following REST best practices would be to use the HTTP PUT method for updating a specific resource identified by 'fraudresolutionid'\. Therefore\, the recommended path name would be '/FraudResolution/\{fraudresolutionid\}' or '/FraudResolution/\{fraudresolutionid\}' to indicate an update operation on the identified resource\.
