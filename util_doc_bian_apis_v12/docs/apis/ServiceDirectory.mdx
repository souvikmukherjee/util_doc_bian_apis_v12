This Service Domain presents a structured set of services that the customer can select from  Retrieve Sales Servicing Properties

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows you to retrieve information about sales servicing properties from a structured set of services listed in the Service Directory\. By providing the "servicedirectoryid" and "salesservicingid" parameters\, you can access details about a specific sales servicing property\. This information can help customers select the appropriate services they need\. The method used in this API path is GET\, which is commonly used for retrieving data from a server\.

**Limitations**

GET: Following REST best practices\, the name of the path should be something that represents a resource's action rather than a specific operation\. Here is a suggestion for the name of the path:

'/ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/SalesServicing/\{salesservicingid\}'

This path represents a specific 'SalesServicing' resource nested under 'ServiceDirectory'\. The URI should accurately and concisely describe the resource represented\, making it clear and meaningful\.

## GET: /ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/ServiceDeliveryServicing/\{servicedeliveryservicingid\}/Retrieve

:::info Path
GET: /ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/ServiceDeliveryServicing/\{servicedeliveryservicingid\}/Retrieve
:::

### Description

This Service Domain presents a structured set of services that the customer can select from  Retrieve Service Delivery Servicing Properties

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows you to retrieve information about a specific service delivery servicing property within a service directory\. It provides access to a structured set of services that customers can choose from\, allowing them to view the properties associated with a particular service delivery servicing\. The GET method indicates that this API is used for retrieving data rather than making changes to it\.

**Limitations**

GET: Based on REST best practices\, the name of the path could be:

GET /services/\{servicedirectoryid\}/servicing/\{servicedeliveryservicingid\}

This path follows the principles of using nouns for resources and using meaningful names to represent the hierarchy of resources\.

## PUT: /ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/AccessControlServicing/\{accesscontrolservicingid\}/Update

:::info Path
PUT: /ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/AccessControlServicing/\{accesscontrolservicingid\}/Update

\`\`\`
PUT /ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/AccessControlServicing/\{accesscontrolservicingid\}
\`\`\` 

This path includes the HTTP method PUT\, which is used for updating a resource\, and includes identifiers for the service directory and access control servicing entities\.

## PUT: /ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/ArrangementServicing/\{arrangementservicingid\}/Update

:::info Path
PUT: /ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/ArrangementServicing/\{arrangementservicingid\}/Update
:::

### Description

## PUT: /ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/ProductAccessServicing/\{productaccessservicingid\}/Update

:::info Path

:::

### Description

**Documentation**

This API path allows you to update the properties of a specific product access servicing within a service directory\. By making a PUT request to this path with the appropriate IDs\, you can modify the details or attributes of the selected product access servicing entry in the service directory\. This can include changing information related to how a product is accessed or serviced within the system\.

**Limitations**

PUT: The name of the path should be as follows according to REST best practices:

'/ServiceDirectories/\{servicedirectoryid\}/ProductAccessServicings/\{productaccessservicingid\}'

## PUT: /ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/RelationshipServicing/\{relationshipservicingid\}/Update

**Documentation**

This API path allows a customer to update the properties of a relationship servicing within a specific service directory\. It allows for the modification of existing resources related to relationship servicing in a structured manner\. By using a PUT request method\, customers can make updates to the properties associated with a particular relationship servicing identified by the relationshipservicingid within the specified servicedirectoryid\.

**Limitations**

PUT: Based on REST best practices\, the name of the path '/ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/RelationshipServicing/\{relationshipservicingid\}/Update' should be simplified to the following:

'/service\-directory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/relationship\-servicing/\{relationshipservicingid\}'

This naming convention follows the guidelines of using lowercase letters\, using hyphens to separate words\, and making the path descriptive and easy to understand\.

## PUT: /ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/SalesServicing/\{salesservicingid\}/Update

:::info Path
PUT: /ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/SalesServicing/\{salesservicingid\}/Update

### Description

This Service Domain presents a structured set of services that the customer can select from  Update Sales Servicing Properties

**Documentation**

This API path is used to update properties related to sales servicing within a structured set of services listed in the Service Directory\. By providing the appropriate service directory ID and sales servicing ID\, the API allows you to update specific information or properties associated with the sales servicing resource\. The PUT method is used to update existing details within this service domain for a more tailored and accurate record of the sales servicing properties\.

**Limitations**

PUT: The name of the path should ideally be something like:

PUT /ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/SalesServicing/\{salesservicingid\}

This path follows REST conventions by using the HTTP method PUT to update an existing resource identified by the \{servicedirectoryid\} and \{salesservicingid\}\. The '/ServiceDirectory' and '/SalesServicing' segments represent the resource hierarchy\, and the use of the PUT method signals the intent to update the resource\.

## PUT: /ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/ServiceDeliveryServicing/\{servicedeliveryservicingid\}/Update

:::info Path
PUT: /ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/ServiceDeliveryServicing/\{servicedeliveryservicingid\}/Update
:::

### Description

This Service Domain presents a structured set of services that the customer can select from  Update Service Delivery Servicing Properties

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows users to update specific properties related to a service delivery servicing within a service directory\. Users can select services from the directory and then update information related to the delivery of that service\. The API uses the PUT method to make changes to an existing resource within the service directory\.

**Limitations**

PUT: The name of the path should reflect the resource being updated rather than the action being performed\. A RESTful path should be noun\-based and represent a resource\. 

Given the path '/ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/ServiceDeliveryServicing/\{servicedeliveryservicingid\}/Update'\, a more appropriate name following REST best practices could be:

'/ServiceDirectory/\{servicedirectoryid\}/ServiceDeliveryServicing/\{servicedeliveryservicingid\}'

This path focuses on the specific resource being updated
