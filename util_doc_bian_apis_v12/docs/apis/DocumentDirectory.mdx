This Service Domain provides a directory based categorization and storage mechanism for documents created and referenced by the bank Retrieve Document Update History Properties

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path is used to retrieve information about the document update history properties of a specific document within the document directory\. The path includes 'documentdirectoryid' and 'documentupdatehistorypropertiesid' as placeholders for identifying the specific document and its update history properties\. By making a GET request to this path\, users can access details related to how a document has been updated over time within the bank's document directory\. It allows users to view the history of changes made to the document's properties\.

**Limitations**

GET: Based on REST best practices\, the name of the path should be:

GET /documentdirectories/\{documentDirectoryId\}/documentupdatehistoryproperties/\{documentUpdateHistoryPropertiesId\} 

This path indicates a GET request to retrieve specific document update history properties within a document directory\. It follows REST conventions by using lowercase letters and hyphens in the path\, using plural nouns for collections \(documentdirectories\, documentupdatehistoryproperties\)\, and using specific resource identifiers \(documentDirectoryId\, documentUpdateHistoryPropertiesId\) instead

### Description

This Service Domain provides a directory based categorization and storage mechanism for documents created and referenced by the bank Update Document Amendment Properties

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows you to update the properties of a specific document amendment within the document directory\. By sending a PUT request to this path with the appropriate document directory ID and document amendment properties ID\, you can modify the details or attributes associated with that particular document amendment\. This functionality facilitates the ability to manage and adjust the properties of documents stored and categorized within the bank's document directory system\.

**Limitations**

PUT: The name of the path following REST best practices could be:

/document\-directories/\{documentDirectoryId\}/document\-amendment\-properties/\{documentAmendmentPropertiesId\}

### Description

This Service Domain provides a directory based categorization and storage mechanism for documents created and referenced by the bank Update Document Archiving Properties

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows you to update the archiving properties of a specific document within the document directory\. By making a PUT request to this path with the document directory ID and the document archiving properties ID\, you can modify the properties associated with that particular document\. These properties might include metadata such as storage location\, access permissions\, or retention policies\. This API essentially enables you to make changes to how a specific document is stored and managed in the document directory of the bank's system\.

**Limitations**

PUT: The appropriate name for the path you mentioned should be:

\`\`\`
/DocumentDirectories/\{documentdirectoryid\}/DocumentArchivingProperties/\{documentarchivingpropertiesid\}
\`\`\`

This path follows REST best practices by using nouns to represent resources \(e\.g\.\, DocumentDirectories\, DocumentArchivingProperties\) and avoids using actions in the URL\. The HTTP methods \(e\.g\.\, PUT\, POST\) should be used to perform actions on these resources\.

## PUT: /DocumentDirectory/\{documentdirectoryid\}/DocumentReferenceProperties/\{documentreferencepropertiesid\}/Update

:::info Path
