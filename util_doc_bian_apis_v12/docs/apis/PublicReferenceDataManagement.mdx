### PUT: /PublicReferenceDataManagement/\{publicreferencedatamanagementid\}/Capture

**Description**

Provide structured access to standard 'global' reference data and definitions associated with market activity such as currency\, country and segment identifiers\. CaCR Capture Global Standard Specification activity or event related information

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows you to update existing resources related to public reference data management\. It provides structured access to standard global reference data and definitions associated with market activities\, such as currency\, country\, and segment identifiers\. You can use this path to capture and update information about activities or events related to global standard specifications\.

**Limitations**

PUT: Based on REST best practices\, the name of the path should be:

\`\`\`
/PublicReferenceDataManagement/\{publicreferencedatamanagementid\}/Capture
\`\`\`

This path follows the best practice of using resource names in the plural form \('PublicReferenceDataManagement'\) and including identifiers in curly braces \('\{publicreferencedatamanagementid\}'\) to represent variables in the path\. The specific operation 'Capture' is also included to indicate what action is being performed on the resource identified by 'publicrefer

### PUT: /PublicReferenceDataManagement/\{publicreferencedatamanagementid\}/Control

**Description**

Provide structured access to standard 'global' reference data and definitions associated with market activity such as currency\, country and segment identifiers\. CoCR Control the processing of Global Standard Specification

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows users to update an existing resource related to public reference data management\. Specifically\, it provides structured access to standard global reference data like currency\, country\, and segment identifiers\. The API helps control the processing of global standard specifications for managing this reference data effectively\.

**Limitations**

PUT: In a RESTful API\, the path segments should be nouns rather than verbs\. Based on the path \`/PublicReferenceDataManagement/\{publicreferencedatamanagementid\}/Control\`\, a more RESTful name for the endpoint could be:

\`/public\-reference\-data/\{publicreferencedatamanagementid\}/controls\`

This name is more descriptive and follows the convention of using plural nouns for collections of resources\.

### PUT: /PublicReferenceDataManagement/\{publicreferencedatamanagementid\}/Exchange
