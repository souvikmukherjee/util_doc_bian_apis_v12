## POST: /TermDeposit/Initiate

:::info Path
POST: /TermDeposit/Initiate
:::

### Description

A Term Deposit is an interest bearing account into which a customer can place a fixed amount of funds for a fixed amount of time\. The Service Domain handles the opening\, servicing and maturity processing of a Term Deposit\.      InCR Initiate A new term deposit account

**Documentation**

This API path "/TermDeposit/Initiate" allows users to create a new term deposit account\. It enables customers to place a fixed amount of funds for a specific period of time into an interest\-bearing account\. The API handles all processes related to opening\, servicing\, and maturing the term deposit account\. This means that users can initiate the setup of a new term deposit account through this API endpoint\.

**Limitations**

POST: Following REST best practices\, the name of the path '/TermDeposit/Initiate' should be revised to use nouns that represent resources rather than verbs\. One suggestion could be using the resource name 'term\-deposits' instead of 'TermDeposit'\. 

So\, the improved path could be '/term\-deposits/initiation' or '/term\-deposits/initiate' based on the specific action being taken\.

## PUT: /TermDeposit/\{termdepositid\}/Update

:::info Path
PUT: /TermDeposit/\{termdepositid\}/Update

### Description

A Term Deposit is an interest bearing account into which a customer can place a fixed amount of funds for a fixed amount of time\. The Service Domain handles the opening\, servicing and maturity processing of a Term Deposit\.      UpCR Update details of a term deposit account

**Documentation**

This API path allows you to update the details of an existing term deposit account\. It is used to modify specific information\, such as the amount of funds placed or the duration of the deposit\. This can be useful for adjustments or changes needed for a term deposit account within the banking system\.

**Limitations**

PUT: In RESTful naming conventions\, the path should represent a resource or a collection of resources rather than actions\. Following this principle\, a more appropriate name for the path you mentioned could be:

\`\`\`
/TermDeposits/\{termdepositid\}
\`\`\`

This reflects the resource \(TermDeposit\) and the specific TermDeposit instance identified by the \{termdepositid\}\. Update operations in REST are typically represented by the HTTP PUT or PATCH methods on the existing resource URI\.

## PUT: /TermDeposit/\{termdepositid\}/Control

:::info Path

:::

### Description

A Term Deposit is an interest bearing account into which a customer can place a fixed amount of funds for a fixed amount of time\. The Service Domain handles the opening\, servicing and maturity processing of a Term Deposit\.      CoCR Control the processing of a term deposit account

By using this API\, you can make changes or updates to the account related to its processing status\.

**Limitations**

PUT: The REST best practice for naming paths involves using nouns to represent resources and avoiding verbs or actions in the path names\. 

In this case\, the path \`'/TermDeposit/\{termdepositid\}/Control'\` could be renamed to \`'/TermDeposits/\{termdepositid\}/Controls'\` to better align with REST conventions\. The path now uses the resource name "Controls" as a plural noun to represent a collection of control resources related to a specific term deposit identified by \`termdepositid

This could include details such as the interest rate\, amount of interest accrued\, date of the transaction\, and any other relevant information pertaining to the interest applied to the account\.

**Limitations**

GET: Following REST best practices\, the name of the path should be something like '/term\-deposits/\{termDepositId\}/interests/\{interestId\}'\. 

Here are some key principles followed in this naming convention:
1\. Use lowercase letters for path segments
2\. Use hyphens to separate words within a path segment

\- Action or operation initiating a service

PUT: Based on REST best practices\, the commonly recommended naming convention for endpoints is to use nouns that represent resources rather than actions\. With that in mind\, a better name for the path '/TermDeposit/\{termdepositid\}/ServiceFees/\{servicefeesid\}/Execute' could be:

\`\`\`
/TermDeposits/\{termdepositid\}/ServiceFees/\{servicefeesid\}
