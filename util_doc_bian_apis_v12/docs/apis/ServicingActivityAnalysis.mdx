**Documentation**

This API path allows you to update existing servicing activity analysis data for continual service improvement\. You can modify aspects related to servicing root cause analysis by providing the servicing activity analysis ID and making changes to the resource using the PUT method\.

**Limitations**

PUT: The name of the path should be:

PUT /servicing\-activity\-analysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}

## PUT: /ServicingActivityAnalysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/Execute

:::info Path
PUT: /ServicingActivityAnalysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/Execute
:::

### Description

This service domain analyzes servicing activity to support continual service improvement ExCR Execute an automated aspect of root cause analysis

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows you to update an existing resource related to servicing activity analysis\. Specifically\, it enables the execution of an automated aspect of root cause analysis for servicing activity data\. By using this API\, you can trigger a process that analyzes the root causes of issues or incidents in servicing activities\, helping to improve the overall quality and efficiency of the services provided\.

**Limitations**

PUT: Based on REST best practices\, the name of the path should be:

GET /servicing\-activity\-analysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/execute

## PUT: /ServicingActivityAnalysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/Request

:::info Path
PUT: /ServicingActivityAnalysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/Request
:::

### Description

This service domain analyzes servicing activity to support continual service improvement RqCR Request manual intervention in servicing root cause analysis

**Documentation**

This API path\, \`/ServicingActivityAnalysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/Request\`\, allows you to update an existing request for manual intervention in servicing root cause analysis within the Servicing Activity Analysis service domain\. It is used to request human intervention to investigate and analyze the root cause of issues related to servicing activities\, which facilitates continual service improvement\.

**Limitations**

PUT: A common naming convention for a resource in RESTful APIs is to use plural nouns to represent collections of resources\. So\, a suitable name for the path \`/ServicingActivityAnalysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/Request\` following REST best practices could be:

\`/ServicingActivityAnalysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/Requests\`

This conveys that the endpoint is dealing with a collection of requests associated with a specific servicing activity analysis identified by \`\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}\`\.

## GET: /ServicingActivityAnalysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/Retrieve

:::info Path
GET: /ServicingActivityAnalysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/Retrieve
:::

### Description

This service domain analyzes servicing activity to support continual service improvement ReCR Retrieve details about servicing root cause analysis

**Documentation**

This API path allows you to retrieve details about servicing root cause analysis for a specific servicing activity analysis\. By using this path with a specific ID associated with the servicing activity analysis\, you can access information about the root cause analysis conducted to support continual service improvement\.

**Limitations**

GET: The name of the path should be:

GET /servicing\-activities/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}

## POST: /ServicingActivityAnalysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/RootCauseAlgorithm/Initiate

:::info Path
POST: /ServicingActivityAnalysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/RootCauseAlgorithm/Initiate
:::

### Description

This service domain analyzes servicing activity to support continual service improvement EvBQ Initialize application of a specific algorithm for root cause analysis

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows you to create a new resource that initiates the application of a specific algorithm for root cause analysis within the Servicing Activity Analysis service domain\. This analysis is aimed at supporting continual service improvement by identifying and addressing the root causes of issues related to servicing activities\.

**Limitations**

POST: Based on REST best practices\, the appropriate name for this path could be something like:

\`\`\`
/servicing\-activity\-analysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/root\-cause\-algorithm/initiate
\`\`\` 

This follows the convention of using lowercase letters\, separating words with hyphens\, and using plural nouns for resource names when applicable\.

## PUT: /ServicingActivityAnalysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/RootCauseAlgorithm/\{rootcausealgorithmid\}/Request

:::info Path
PUT: /ServicingActivityAnalysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/RootCauseAlgorithm/\{rootcausealgorithmid\}/Request
:::

### Description

This service domain analyzes servicing activity to support continual service improvement RqBQ Request manual intervention to the application of a root cause algorithm

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows you to update a request for manual intervention in applying a root cause algorithm for analyzing servicing activity to support continual service improvement\. You can specify the servicing activity analysis ID and the root cause algorithm ID to request manual intervention in the application of the algorithm\. This functionality aims to help improve services based on the analysis of servicing activities\.

**Limitations**

PUT: A better name for the path could be:

GET '/servicing\-activities/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/root\-cause\-algorithms/\{rootcausealgorithmid\}/request'

## GET: /ServicingActivityAnalysis/\{servicingactivityanalysisid\}/RootCauseAlgorithm/\{rootcausealgorithmid\}/Retrieve
