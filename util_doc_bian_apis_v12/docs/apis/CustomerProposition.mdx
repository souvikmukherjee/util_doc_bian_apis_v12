**Description**

This Service Domain maintains bank and customer defined requirements spanning all products and services Control Customer Proposition Agreement

**Documentation**

This BIAN API path allows you to update existing customer proposition agreements by specifying the ID of the specific customer proposition\. This service domain helps manage and enforce requirements set by both the bank and the customer across all products and services included in the proposition agreement\.

**Limitations**

PUT: The recommended name for this path would be:

\`\`\`
