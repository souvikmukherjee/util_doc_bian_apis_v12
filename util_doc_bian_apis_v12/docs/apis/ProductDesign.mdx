By making a PUT request to this endpoint with the relevant IDs\, users can update and maintain the details of the product design and functional requirements in a standardized and structured manner\.

**Limitations**

PUT: Following REST best practices\, the recommended name for the path '/ProductDesign/\{productdesignid\}/FunctionalRequirements/\{functionalrequirementsid\}/Capture' should be something like '/products/\{productId\}/functional\-requirements/\{requirementId\}/capture'\. This naming convention uses lower case letters\, separates words with dashes\, and represents resources using plural nouns\.

### PUT: /ProductDesign/\{productdesignid\}/FunctionalRequirements/\{functionalrequirementsid\}/Request

**Description**

Develop/refine product designs and supporting specification details RqBQ Request changes or improvements to the specification

**Documentation**
